# Microservices Architecture with Django, Keycloak, Kafka, and React

##sum: This app allows admin to create appointment for patients at the hospital

## Introduction
Microservices architecture is a modern approach to building scalable, resilient, and maintainable applications. In this system, we use:

- **Keycloak** for authentication
- **Apache Kafka** as the message bus
- **Django** for backend services
- **React** for the frontend
- **Docker** to containerize everything and run locally

### System Components
The system consists of four microservices:

1. **User Management** – Handles authentication and user profiles.
2. **Appointment** – Manages appointment scheduling.
3. **Analytics** – Collects system usage data.
4. **Notification** – Sends notifications based on events.

## Why Microservices?
Traditional monolithic applications often struggle with scalability and maintainability. Microservices offer several advantages:

- **Scalability**: Independent services can scale separately.
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn’t bring down the entire system.
- **Flexibility**: Services can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently.

## The Tech Stack
- **Django** – Backend framework for each microservice.
- **React** – Frontend application.
- **Keycloak** – Centralized authentication and authorization.
- **Apache Kafka** – Message broker for event-driven communication.
- **PostgreSQL** – Primary database.
- **Docker** – Every service, including Keycloak, Kafka, and the frontend, is containerized.

## Microservices Breakdown

### 1. User Management Microservice
- Handles user profiles and authentication.
- Uses Keycloak for issuing JWT tokens.
- Publishes user-events to Kafka (e.g., when a user registers).

### 2. Appointment Microservice
- Manages user appointments.
- Listens for user-events from Kafka.
- Emits appointment-events when an appointment is created.

### 3. Analytics Microservice
- Collects system-wide usage data.
- Consumes user-events and appointment-events from Kafka.
- Stores aggregated data for reporting.

### 4. Notification Microservice
- Listens for appointment-events.
- Sends email, SMS, or push notifications.
- Uses **Celery** with **Redis** for handling retries.

## Running the System Locally
To run the system locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

### 2. Run Keycloak
Navigate to the `stack/` directory and start Keycloak:

```bash
cd stack
docker-compose -f keycloak-docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### 3. Run Apache Kafka
Start Kafka in the same directory:

```bash
docker-compose -f kafka-docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### 4. Run All Microservices
To start all microservices and the frontend app:

```bash
docker-compose -f services-docker-compose.yml up -d
```



## Conclusion
This system, built using microservices, Django, Keycloak, Kafka, and React, provides a scalable, resilient, and maintainable solution. By using Docker, you can easily run all the components locally.
